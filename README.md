- Double-sided pcb (pcb can be used as left or right half)
- Pro Micro compatible footprint
- Easy to print, FDM-friendly two-piece case

## By the way

Awesome libs used:

- [kbd.pretty](https://github.com/foostan/kbd) by foostan
- [keyswitches.pretty](https://github.com/daprice/keyswitches.pretty) by daprice

Also closest alternatives are:

- [raychengy/fifi](https://github.com/raychengy/fifi_split_keeb): non choc (mx switches)
- [davidphilipbarr/chocorne](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/36keys/tree/master/42Keys/chocorne): non hotswap but choc-spaced corne (you can break off one column so it will be 5x3, but with corne pinky stagger)


This Fork enlarges one of the mounting holes (H7) and centers it to accommodate a trackpoint.
Hasn't been tested yet.
